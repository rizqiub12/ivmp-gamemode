# Summary #

The ACS provides a highly complete selection of commands for server staff to handle users. Admin command permissions are handled through an ACL file which designates acl groups, a.k.a admin levels, and commands, as well as functions, permitted by each group. Admin levels are stored as account data. Developers can modify the acl file to remove or add acl groups as well as include additional commands or functions to be assigned permission requirements.
